Standard Operating Procedure for Data Preprocessing
Overview
This procedure outlines the initial preprocessing steps of the data pipeline, focusing on mannequin data creation, data merging, and specialized preprocessing for the TACERA reproduction dataset.
Procedure

Mannequin Data Creation (1.Create_mannequinpe_file.ipynb)

Generate template data structures for standard analysis
Create standardized data formats for subsequent processing
Establish baseline reference points
Validate mannequin file integrity


Data Integration (2.Merging_data_publish.ipynb)

Import and consolidate data from multiple sources
Resolve inconsistencies in data formats
Validate merged dataset integrity
Apply initial cleaning and standardization
Prepare unified dataset for analytical pipeline


TACERA Dataset Preprocessing (TACERA_preprocess.ipynb)

Import and prepare the separate TACERA reproduction dataset
Apply dataset-specific cleaning and formatting
Standardize TACERA data to match pipeline requirements
Extract relevant features from the TACERA dataset
Prepare TACERA data for comparison with primary dataset
Validate preprocessed reproduction data compatibility



This preprocessing sequence establishes both the primary analytical dataset and prepares the separate TACERA reproduction dataset for comparative analysis. The TACERA preprocessing creates a parallel data stream that will be used for validation and comparison purposes later in the analysis pipeline.
