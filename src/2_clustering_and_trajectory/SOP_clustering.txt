Standard Operating Procedure for Clustering and Trajectory Analysis
Overview
This procedure describes the clustering and trajectory analysis component (2_clustering_and_trajectory) of the data pipeline, detailing the sequential approach to defining clusters and extracting trajectories using multiple methodologies.
Procedure

Initial Clustering with K Definition (a1_clustering_defining_Knn.ipynb)

Determine optimal number of connection for the leiden algorithm (K) using statistical methods
Evaluate cluster quality and stability



Leiden Algorithm Clustering (a2_Leiden_clustering.ipynb)

Apply Leiden community detection algorithm to the preprocessed data using the K from step 1
Generate community structures


Trajectory Definition with Knn Clusters (a3_clustering_defining_Knn_trajectories.ipynb)

Determine optimal number of connection for the leiden algorithm (K) using statistical methods
Evaluate trajectory quality and stability




Leiden-based Trajectory Analysis (a4_Leiden_trajectories.ipynb)

Extract trajectories from Leiden community structures
Apply trajectory algorithm
Quantify trajectory characteristics
Compare with K-based trajectory outcomes


TACERA Clustering Implementation (b1_TACERA_clustering.ipynb)

Apply clustering based on findings of leiden on the TACERA dataset
Evaluate dynamic cluster formation



TACERA Trajectory Extraction (b2_TACERA_trajectories.ipynb)

Generate trajectories from TACERA clusters
Analyze temporal evolution of trajectories
Calculate trajectory metrics specific to time-aware clusters


This procedure should be followed sequentially as each notebook builds upon the results of previous analyses.
