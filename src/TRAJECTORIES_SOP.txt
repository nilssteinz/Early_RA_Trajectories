Standard Operating Procedure for Data Analysis Pipeline
Overview
This procedure outlines the step-by-step workflow for processing and analyzing trajectory data, following a sequential approach from preprocessing through post-hoc analysis, with supporting utilities.
Procedure

Data Preprocessing (1_preprocess)

Raw data is imported and cleaned
Formatting standardization is applied
Initial filtering of outliers is performed
Data is prepared for subsequent analysis


Clustering and Trajectory Analysis (2_clustering_and_trajectory)

Cleaned data is segmented into clusters
Initial trajectory identification is performed
Pattern recognition algorithms are applied to identify movement patterns


Trajectory Prediction (3_trajectory_prediction)

Predictive models are applied to clustered trajectory data
Future positions/movements are forecasted
Prediction accuracy is evaluated


Post-hoc Analysis (4_Post_hoc_analysis)

post-hoc data description and table creation
Visualization of results is generated
Insights and recommendations are formulated



Supporting Components

Utilities (utils)

Common functions used across multiple pipeline stages
Helper methods for data transformation
Shared configuration settings
Logging and error handling mechanisms



This SOP should be followed sequentially, with each step building on the output of the previous step. The utilities module provides support throughout the entire process.
