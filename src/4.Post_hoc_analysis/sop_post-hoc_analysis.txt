Standard Operating Procedure for Post-hoc Analysis of Trajectory Data
Overview
This procedure outlines the post-hoc analysis workflow for trajectory data, focusing on validation, statistical assessment, and visualization of trajectory patterns identified in earlier pipeline stages.
Procedure

DMARD Trajectory Survival Analysis (dmard_survival.ipynb)

Evaluate how identified trajectories correlate with DMARD treatment outcomes
Perform survival analysis stratified by trajectory groups
Document clinical significance of trajectory findings


Trajectory Visualization and Reporting (tables_and_figures.ipynb)

Generate publication-ready visualizations of key trajectories
Create comparison tables showing trajectory characteristics
Format trajectory statistics for scientific presentation
Develop visual representations of trajectory-outcome relationships
Structure findings to communicate trajectory clinical relevance



This post-hoc analysis workflow validates the clinical significance of previously identified trajectories, assesses their predictive value for treatment outcomes, and prepares comprehensive visualizations for scientific communication of trajectory patterns and their implications.
