Certainly! Here's a basic Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) template tailored for the `sop_trajectories` directory in the [Early\_RA\_Trajectories](https://github.com/nilssteinz/Early_RA_Trajectories) repository. This SOP is designed to guide researchers through the process of identifying disease trajectories in early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients.
