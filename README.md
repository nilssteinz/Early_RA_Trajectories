# Early RA Trajectories

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper:

**"Time-independent disease state identification defines distinct trajectories determined by localised vs systemic inflammation in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis."**

## Overview

The project focuses on identifying disease states in early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients without relying on time-dependent data. By distinguishing between localized and systemic inflammation, the study defines distinct disease trajectories, offering insights into RA progression.
