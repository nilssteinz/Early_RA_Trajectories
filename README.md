# Early RA Trajectories

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper:

**"Time-independent disease state identification defines distinct trajectories determined by localised vs systemic inflammation in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis."**

## Overview

The project focuses on identifying disease states in early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients without relying on time-dependent data. By distinguishing between localized and systemic inflammation, the study defines distinct disease trajectories, offering insights into RA progression.

## Repository Structure

* **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for data analysis and modeling.
* **`sop_trajectories/`**: Includes standard operating procedures and supplementary materials related to trajectory analysis.
* **`README.md`**: Provides an overview and instructions for using the repository.
